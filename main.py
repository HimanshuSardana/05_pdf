# Tasks to be performed
# Step-1: Transform each value of x into z using the transformation function given below.
# z = Tr(x) = x + arsin(brx) (1)
# where ar = 0.05 ∗ (r mod 7), br = 0.3 ∗ (r mod 5 + 1)
# where, mod returns remainder and r is your UNIVERSITY ROLL NUMBER.
# Step-2: Learn parameters of the following probability density function using any
# estimation technique or by using any machine learning technique.
#
# p̂(z) = c ∗ e
# −λ(z−μ)
# 2 (2)
# Where, p̂(z) is the predicted probability of the transformed variable z. In this step, you
# have to learn parameters λ, μ and c in Eq.(2).
